# TimeSeries

Given the flow rate, pressure, temperature, and composition of inlet feed gas to a cracker unit,
create a predictive model to forecast the fluctuation of the feed for the next 8 hours.
This model can be used to calculate the optimal loading of equipment and to ensure a
given quality of cracking, as well as the optimal operating conditions of the equipment.
This can in turn reduce the consumption of electrical energy by the plant.
